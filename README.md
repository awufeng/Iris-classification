Overview
In the realm of machine learning and computer vision, accurately classifying plant species from images is a significant challenge with numerous practical applications in agriculture, botany, and conservation. This project aims to develop a machine learning model to solve a practical problem in plant species identification, classifying Iris flowers into three distinct species: setosa, versicolor, and Virginia.  

About Dataset
Most data scientists are familiar with Fisher's Iris Dataset. The original Iris dataset was used in R.A. Fisher's classic 1936 paper, The Use of Multiple Measurements in Taxonomic Problems, and can also be found on the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The dataset presented here provides images for the space species of iris that were chosen by Fisher.
