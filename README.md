In the realm of machine learning and computer vision, accurately classifying plant species from images is a significant challenge with numerous practical applications in agriculture, botany, and conservation. 

This project aims to develop a machine learning model to solve a practical problem in plant species identification, classifying Iris flowers into three distinct species: setosa, versicolor, and virginia.
